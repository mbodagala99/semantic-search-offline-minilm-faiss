    "purpose": "This index serves as the comprehensive repository for healthcare provider information, supporting provider network management, credentialing, quality assessment, and patient care coordination across healthcare organizations. It enables detailed analysis of provider demographics, specialties, credentials, affiliations, performance metrics, and network adequacy. The index supports advanced semantic search capabilities for provider discovery, network optimization, credentialing verification, quality reporting, and patient matching. It facilitates real-time querying of provider availability, specialty coverage, geographic distribution, performance indicators, and credentialing status. This comprehensive data structure enables healthcare administrators, network managers, credentialing specialists, and quality assurance teams to manage provider networks effectively, ensure credentialing compliance, analyze provider performance, optimize network adequacy, and generate detailed provider reports for network optimization, quality improvement initiatives, and strategic decision-making. The index supports complex analytical queries including geographic analysis of provider distribution, specialty analysis of network coverage, performance analysis of provider outcomes, credentialing analysis of compliance status, and predictive modeling for network planning and provider recruitment.",
