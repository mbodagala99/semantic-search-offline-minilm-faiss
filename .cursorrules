# Cursor AI Rules for Healthcare Search Project

## Setup and Documentation Rule
- ALWAYS use the existing `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file for ALL setup, startup, and termination related instructions
- NEVER create additional setup, startup, or termination documentation files
- If setup instructions need updates, modify `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` directly
- This prevents documentation fragmentation and maintains a single source of truth

## Virtual Environment Rule
- ALWAYS activate the virtual environment before running any Python code or installing packages
- Use: `source venv/bin/activate` before executing Python scripts or pip commands
- Ensure all Python operations are performed within the activated virtual environment

## Code Implementation Rule
- Implement tasks in a MINIMALIST fashion
- Write code that meets only the basic requirements
- Do NOT add additional capabilities or features beyond what is explicitly requested
- Keep code simple, focused, and essential-only
- Avoid over-engineering or adding unnecessary complexity

## File Organization Rule
- Keep the project structure clean and simple
- Avoid creating redundant files
- Use existing scripts (`start.sh`, `stop.sh`) for application control
- Reference `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for all setup-related guidance

## Document Creation Rule
- DO NOT create any new documents unless explicitly requested in the user prompt
- Only create files when the user specifically asks for a document to be created
- If documentation is needed, update existing relevant files instead of creating new ones
- This prevents unnecessary file proliferation and keeps the project clean
- When in doubt, ask the user if they want a document created before proceeding
